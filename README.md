Personal Finance Tracker with Inmemory Database

This is a simple finance tracker with inmemory database, I had learned Java initially when I started learning programming but then I got interest in data analysis so shifted focus to python and R.
Still, as I had learned much of the Core Java it was worth it to showcase those basic skills in a project show I created this project and used an inmemory database a real database would require me to learn further details of Java which wouldn't be of much use as my focus is towrds data analysis and finance.
